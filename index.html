    <p>With a brisk fall upon us, it's time to warm up with some fall favorites featuring butternut squash and apples. The sweet and savory aspect of fall recipes makes them my favorite, and I enjoy trying new ones every year.</p>
    <p>This <a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/butternut-squash-soup/">butternut squash soup</a> recipe by Love and Lemons is a fall staple featuring butternut squash, garlic, onion, sage, and rosemary. With a total cook time of 45 minutes, this recipe is perfect for someone who wants a quick, easy, and comforting soup they can enjoy with friends and family. This soup is also easy to freeze for a later time.</p>
    <p>As someone who is not always a huge fan of pumpkin, apples are my go ingredient for fall desserts. The <a href="https://www.thechunkychef.com/old-fashioned-easy-apple-crisp/">Old Fashioned Easy Apple Crisp </a>recipe by The Chunky Chef is among one of my favorite desserts that I crave year-round. This recipe uses spiced apples and a crispy oat topping to make the perfect apple crisp that can be enjoyed with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. My favorite thing about this recipe is how versatile it is. Any variety of apple will do, and they do not have to be peeled in order to achieve a delicious apple crisp.</p>

    <h3>Nutrition and Wellness Tips for Busy College Students</h3>

    <p>While college is an exciting time for most students, it also comes with its own set of challenges. Among them include prioritizing health and wellness, physically and mentally. Below are some tips that can help you stay healthy and on track with your goals, all while battling a busy schedule.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Prioritize Healthy Eating:</b> A healthy diet is crucial for physical and mental well-being. Fruits, yogurt, and nuts are excellent snack options for those on the go.</li>
      <li><b>Get Enough Sleep:</b> While it can be easy to lose track of time and pull an all-nighter studying or hanging out with friends, it is important to get at least 7-9 hours of sleep per night to help improve concentration and academic performance, reduce stress, and fight off infections.</li>
      <li><b>Stay Hydrated:</b> Drinking 7-8 glasses of water a day can help improve brain function, increase energy, prevent headaches, and improve digestion. Carrying a reusable water bottle makes it easy to achieve this goal, and they can easily be refiled at one of the many drinking fountains around campus.</li>
      <li><b>Exercise Regularly:</b> Biking or walking to class can be a great source of exercise for those who are busy and cannot fit enough time to go to the gym into their schedules.</li>
    </ul>
